This project was at the beginning of my ece 275 class.
We were tasked with correctly analyzing different situations on a go board. We had to
correctly display the board, and show whether there any of the three formations we were
looking for (eyes, twoeyes, and eyespaces) in regards to the black pieces.

This program requires there be an input file that gives the program the location of all of the pieces on the board.
